			<p> First, fill out your family tree on <a href="https://familysearch.org/" target="_blank"> familysearch.org. </a> We get
				our data from Family Search, so this step is important. Once your tree is sufficiently filled out, log in to FamGraph.
				Once you log in, you'll see a gallery of graphs to select from. The team here at FamGraph is always adding and updating
				our graphs, so check back often! </p>

			<p> Select a graph and check it out. We use the <a href="www.d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> library to display your family
				history data. Our graphs are pretty self explanatory, but if you need some extra instruction, check out the directions
				that are placed below each graph. This will tell you what the graph is plotting. Oftentimes, users discover things about
				their families that they never knew! </p>

		<div class="about-component">
			<img src="images/about-icons-03.png" alt="Settings Icon">
			<p> Our graphs have customizeable settings that let you explore your family tree data in different ways. Sorting by gender,
				age, and generation, are just a few of the options we allow users to manipulate. Play around with the settings - this
				will lead to more insights about your family tree! </p>
