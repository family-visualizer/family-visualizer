Once your tree is sufficiently filled out, login to FamGraph. Once you login, you'll see a gallery of graphs to select from. The team here at FamGraph is always adding and updating our graphs, so check back often!</p></div><div class="about-component"><img src="images/about-icons-02.png" alt="Graph Icon"><p>Select a graph and check it out. Our graphs are pretty self explanatory, but if you need some extra instruction, check out the directions that are placed below each graph. This will tell you what the graph is plotting. Oftentimes, users discover things about their families that they never new before the very first time they look at one of our graphs!</p></div><div class="about-component"><img src="images/about-icons-03.png" alt="Settings Icon"><p>Our graphs oftentimes have customizeable settings that lets you explore your family tree data in different ways. Sorting by gender, age, and generation, are just a few of the options we allow users to manipulate on our various graphs. Play around with the settings - oftentimes this will also lead to more discovery about your family tree.</p></div></div><hr><div><span><h1>1</h1><i class="fa fa-3x fa-arrow-circle-right"></i><h1>2</h1><i class="fa fa-3x fa-arrow-circle-right"></i><h1>3</h1></span></div><hr><!-- <i class="fa fa-3x fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>
